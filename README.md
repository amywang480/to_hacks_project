# <Finalized App Name> TOHacks 2020

Welcome to <Finalized App Name Here>!

## Some Information:

This project is designed as a utility to help people monitor both their mental and physical health using metrics derived from various health organizations. Especially now,
people are struggling with keeping balance in their lives due to the impact of COVID-19. People have lost their routines, and the isolation isn't helping. Because of this,
we are seeking to help people restore some semblance of balance to their lives through widely accessible technology.

By measuring various metrics and looking for trends in mood, the project will reveal to its user where they are struggling, whether they are aware of it or not. It also
provides various resources for people that may be struggling, whether that means inspiration through quotes, help through mental health helplines, or suggestions about
staying active even when you can't leave your house.

Using the Google tools Firebase and Flutter, this app is designed to maximize utility and accessibility while aiming to help people balance their everyday lives.
