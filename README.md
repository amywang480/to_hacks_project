# eHealth TOHacks 2020

Welcome to eHealth!

## Some Information:

This project is designed as a utility to help people monitor both their mental and physical health using metrics derived from various health organizations. Especially now,
people are struggling with keeping balance in their lives due to the impact of COVID-19. People have lost their routines, and the isolation isn't helping. Because of this,
we are seeking to help people restore some semblance of balance to their lives through widely accessible technology.

Using the Google tool Flutter, this app is designed to maximize utility and accessibility while aiming to help people balance their everyday lives.
